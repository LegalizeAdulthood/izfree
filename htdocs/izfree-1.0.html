<H1>What's New For Version 1.0</H1>

<P>This is an alpha release.  I have tested the release on my own machine
(Windows 2000 Professional SP2, Visual C++ SP6, IE 5.01), but not on any
others.  If you encounter problems with the software, please file a
bug report on the izfree SourceForge project page.</P>

<P>This 1.0 alpha release improves upon the previous 0.2 release as
follows.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>Project now housed on SourceForge.net</P>

<P>SourceForge provides a way for any other interested developers to
contribute to izfree.  It also provides a way for users to record
problem reports and feature requests for izfree.</P>

<LI><P>Packaged as an HTML Application</P>

<P>Previously, the script was hosted in a plain HTML file.  When
script in a plain HTML file attempts to create local objects on
the system, such as the Windows Installer automation interface
object, Internet Explorer displays a security warning dialog box
to the user.  The warning box comes up every time the tools are
invoked, unless the web page is added to the trusted zone in the
internet security settings.</P>

<P>An HTML application is given the trust of a locally installed
application, as opposed to a web page obtained from the untrusted
public internet.  Thus, the security dialogs are no longer an
annoyance with an HTML application.  An HTML application can also
provide a more 'application-like' main window as opposed to a web
browser-like main window.</P>

<LI><P>Interface reworked</P>

<P>The interface was reworked so that a single tool pane is replaced
with the form for the selected tool instead of having all the
tools as forms on a single page.</P>

<LI><P>Values of selected form inputs are persisted in the registry</P>

<P>Version 0.2 had fixed default values for the form inputs to the
various tools.  Version 1.0 persists the values of selected form
inputs in the registry.  Now when you browse for a template
directory, that setting is remembered in successive invocations of
the tool.</P>

<LI><P>Files and directories can be selected with common dialogs</P>

<P>File and directory locations can now be browsed for interactively
with standard Windows dialogs.</P>

<LI><P>guidgen.exe dependency eliminated</P>

<P>Version 0.2 used the guidgen.exe tool from the Platform SDK or
Visual Studio for generating GUIDs.  Version 1.0 provides an
in-process COM object written in C++ for generating GUIDs that is
used by izfree.</P>

<LI><P>msimerg.exe dependency eliminated</P>

<P>Version 0.2 used the msimerg.exe tool from the MSI SDK to merge
template databases when creating a blank database.  Version 1.0
uses the database merge methods in the Windows Installer
automation interface, eliminating the dependency on msimerg.exe.</P>

<LI><P>Uses merge modules for its DLL dependencies</P>

<P>Even a script can have DLL dependencies through its use of
CreateObject and ProgIds.  The Version 1.0 install has been merged
with appropriate merge modules to ensure that the appropriate
version of the components are used.  (Note: since I already -have-
the components on my system, this hasn't been completely tested.
If you have problems installing izfree on an older system, please
file a bug report on sourceforge.)</P>

<LI><P>Default install location of [Program Files]\izfree</P>

<P>Version 0.2 did not explicitly initialize TARGETDIR, resulting in
a default installation location of the system drive's root drive.
Version 1.0 uses a custom action to format the TARGETDIR property
to the izfree subdirectory of the program files folder.</P>

<LI><P>Provides a shortcut to izfree under Start / Programs</P>

<P>Version 0.2 did not provide a shortcut to the HTML file containing
the tools.  Version 1.0 provides a shortcut to the HTML
Application under Start / Programs.</P>

<LI><P>Uses AppSearch and LaunchCondition tables to check for IE5 </P>

<P>HTML Applications, stored in .HTA files, require Internet Explorer
5 or better to be installed.  The AppSearch and LaunchCondition
tables and actions are used to verify that at least IE5 is
installed on the system.  If not, a warning message is displayed
informing the user that the install cannot continue without IE5
along with their version of IE that is installed, if any.</P>

<LI><P>Includes database templates</P>

<P>To make izfree a more 'stand-alone' kind of application, database
templates are provided for use with the 'New Package' tool.  If
your application's installation consists only of copying files to
the target machine, then izfree can generate a complete install for
that application from the template.</P>

<LI><P>Generates the UpgradeCode property for new packages</P>

<P>Version 0.2 did not include an UpgradeCode property in the
Property table.  Version 1.0 now provides a form input on the New
Package tool for the upgrade code property value.</P>
</UL>

<H3>Future Work</H3>

<P>These are some of the ideas for things I will be adding to izfree over
time.  If you have something specific you'd like automated, feel free
to add a feature request on the izfree SourceForge.net project page.
I've entered specifics about these ideas there in the Feature Requests
tracker and the Tasks tracker.  If you are interested in helping with
the development of izfree, join SourceForge and email me to be added
to the project.</P>
