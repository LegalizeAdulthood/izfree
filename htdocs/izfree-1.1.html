<!--
<P>This is an alpha release.  I have tested the release on my own machine
(Windows 2000 Professional SP2, Visual C++ SP6, IE 5.01), but not on any
others.  If you encounter problems with the software, please file a
bug report on the izfree SourceForge project page.</P>
-->

<P>This 1.1 alpha release improves upon the previous 1.0 release as
follows.</P>

<UL>
<LI><P>Application is database-centric</P>

<P>Previously, the HTML application treated each tool as its own
isolated world, opening and closing the database each time a tool was
used.  izfree now has a database-centric model, where the current open
database is shown at the top of the main window.  An asterisk next to
the database name indicates that changes have been made to the
database but not yet saved.</P>

<LI><P>New package tool is a modal dialog</P>

<P>In accordance with the new database-centric model of izfree,
creating a new package is now packaged in a modal dialog.  You either
open an existing database, or create a new one.  When you create a new
database, that becomes the current database.</P>

<LI><P>Improved dialog preview</P>

<P>izfree now lists the names of standard dialogs corresponding to the
negative sequence numbers of the <STRONG>InstallUISequence</STRONG>
table, the dialog named by the <STRONG>ErrorDialog</STRONG> property,
as well as all authored dialogs listed in the
<STRONG>InstallUISequence</STRONG> table.</P>

<P>For each dialog, any <STRONG>NewDialog</STRONG> control events that
move to the next dialog in a sequence are displayed for the selected
dialog.  Selecting an event shows any condition and ordering
information associated with the control event.  Double-clicking an
event selects the corresponding dialog invoked by the event, allowing
a quick click-through of a dialog wizard sequence.</P>

<LI><P>New table validation tool</P>

<P>The table validation tool shows all pertinent information for any
column in any table in the open database.  This is handy for learning
more about the allowed values when editing columns in Orca.</P>

<LI><P>Enhancements to New Component tool</P>

<P>The previous version supported creating new components from a
directory tree in a blank database.  No attempts were made to
coordinate the new database table entries with existing database table
entries.</P>

<P>The new components tool now coordinates more with the existing
database table entries so that new components can be added to an
existing installation database.</P>

</UL>

<H3>Future Work</H3>

<P>These are some of the ideas for things I will be adding to izfree over
time.  If you have something specific you'd like automated, feel free
to add a feature request on the izfree SourceForge.net project page.
I've entered specifics about these ideas there in the Feature Requests
tracker and the Tasks tracker.  If you are interested in helping with
the development of izfree, join SourceForge and email me to be added
to the project.</P>
