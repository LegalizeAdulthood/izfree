<H2>Tutorial 5: Registering a COM Object</H2>

<P>This tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with COM, but not
necessarily familiar with how Windows Installer registers COM
objects.  For more information about COM, see the Platform SDK
documentation.</P> 

<P>COM objects are reusable bits of software distributed in binary
form.  COM objects register themselves with the system to make
themselves accessible to applications.  Registration is the process of
writing data to the system registry that identifies the location of
the COM object's executable file and its properties.</P>

<P>COM objects installed by an application need to be registered on the
target machine.  Similarly, the registration information must be
removed when the object itself is removed.  Windows Installer provides
several tables for recording the registration information for a COM
object.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Class</STRONG>,
<STRONG>ProgId</STRONG>,
<STRONG>TypeLib</STRONG>,
<STRONG>AppId</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Extension</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Registry</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Verb</STRONG>, and
<STRONG>MIME</STRONG> tables provide for the registration of COM
objects.  There is quite a bit of information in those tables, and its
quite tedious to enter it all by hand.  However, doing so at least
once will make you familiar with the purpose of all the tables and how
they are used in your installation.  This understanding is invaluable
in debugging COM registration problems.</P>

<P>izfree uses a COM object to generate new GUIDs for use with
Windows Installer.  This tutorial will use izfree's installation and
registration of this COM object, in <CODE>guidgen.dll</CODE>, as an
example.  The Zoom application used in other tutorials does not
contain any COM objects.</P>
<H3>A Manual Example</H3><P>First, let's take a look at manually registering a COM object forsome concrete examples with the COM related tables.</P>
<OL>
<LI><P>First, gather the necessary registration information for your
code.  This involves at a minimum your object's CLSID information under
<CODE>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{</CODE><EM>your guid</EM><CODE>}</CODE>
when the object is registered.  If the component is not registered, then
you will have to extract the necessary information from your source code
or documentation.  Information under your object's CLSID is entered into
corresdonding entries in the <STRONG>Class</STRONG> table.  Make a note
of any information that you haven't yet entered into the class table
for later.</P>

<P>izfree's <STRONG>Class</STRONG> table has this entry for the
GUID generator object.  The <STRONG>AppId_</STRONG>,
<STRONG>FileTypeMask</STRONG>, <STRONG>Icon_</STRONG>,
<STRONG>IconIndex</STRONG>, <STRONG>DefInprocHandler</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Argument</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Attributes</STRONG> columns are
<EM>NULL</EM>.

<LI><P>guidgen has a default ProgId specified in the
<STRONG>Class</STRONG> table.  Its ProgId information also needs to be
entered into the <STRONG>ProgId</STRONG> table.  First, the
version-dependent ProgId is associated with its specific COM server.
guidgen's version-dependent ProgId has this entry in the ProgId

<LI><P>guidgen is a scriptable object and needs its type library
registered to register its interfaces and provide type information to
scripting development tools.  guidgen's type library is compiled into
its executable, <CODE>guidgen.dll</CODE>.  The type library can be
registered when the guidgen component is installed by adding the
following row to the <STRONG>TypeLib</STRONG> table:</P>

<P><TABLE BORDER=1>

</TABLE></P>

<P>The <STRONG>LibID</STRONG> column gives the GUID for the type
library.  You will need to extract this from the registration
information for your COM object.  The <STRONG>Version</STRONG> column
encodes the major and minor versions as major*256 + minor.</P>

<LI><P>Finally, additional information about the COM server may need
to be written into the registry.  Not every COM registry key is
directly supported by a Windows Installer database table.  Take the
list of registration information you created in step 1, and cross off
every bit of registration information that has already been accounted
for by the <STRONG>Class</STRONG>, <STRONG>ProgId</STRONG>, and
<STRONG>TypeLib</STRONG> tables.
In the case of guidgen, it has the a <CODE>ThreadingModel</CODE>
setting, a <CODE>Programmable</CODE> component category and a type
library setting.</P>

<P>These settings are entered into the <STRONG>Registry</STRONG> table

<P>The keys in the <STRONG>Registry</STRONG> column only have the
requirement that they be unique.  Here, keys were chosen to be
semantically meaningful to a human reader.</P>

<LI><P>guidgen doesn't provide any new file types, so there are no entries
in the <STRONG>Extension</STRONG>, <STRONG>MIME</STRONG> or
<STRONG>Verb</STRONG> tables.  Similarly, guidgen is meant to be used
as a local inproc server only, not as a distributed application
server, so it has no entries in the <STRONG>AppId</STRONG> table.</P>

<LI><P>Validate the database and correct any mistakes made in editing
before saving your modified database.</P>

<LI><P>Repeat each of these steps for each object that you need to
register.</P>
</OL>

<H3>An Automated Example</H3><P>Now that you have an understanding of the kind of data written intothe COM-related tables, let's take a look at how izfree 1.1 can automatethis for us. izfree 1.1 can automatically extract COM registration
information from self-registering COM objects.  Most COM objects are
self-registering, which means that they can be asked to record their
own registration information on the target system.  When a COM object
self-registers, Windows Installer cannot provide advanced features such
as self-repair or advertisement.</P>

<P>izfree takes a small snapshot of the system and then asks the COM
object to register itself.  After the registration has completed, izfree
compares the system's state after the registration with that taken in the
snapshot.  The differences between the system before and after
self-registration are used to populate the COM-related tables.</P>

<P>izfree 1.1 will also notice actions taken on services during
self-registration and will use that information to populate the
<STRONG>ServiceControl</STRONG> and <STRONG>ServiceInstall</STRONG>
tables.</P>
<P>The COM registration tool in izfree 1.1 assumes that the COM object'sfile and component has already been incorporated into the database.  This
can be done manually or with izfree's new component tool.</P>

<P>This example will use a fictitious program called '<CODE>Bazooka</CODE>'
that contains two COM objects.  The first COM object is a DLL server called
<CODE>testdll.dll</CODE> and the second COM object is an EXE server called
<CODE>service.exe</CODE>.  <CODE>service.exe</CODE> is a Windows NT service
EXE created with ATL.  When the ATL AppWizard creates a service EXE project,it inserts code to create the service in the self-registration code for the
EXE.</P>
<OL>
<LI><P>Launch izfree and open a database that has been prepared with<STRONG>File</STRONG> and <STRONG>Component</STRONG> table entries for
your COM object.</P>

<LI><P>Select the COM registration tool.  The following form is
displayed.</P>

<P><TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="images/tut5-1.png.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></TD>
<TD><A HREF="images/tut5-1.png">17K PNG</A>,<BR>
<A HREF="images/tut5-1.jpg">71K JPEG</A></TD></TR></TABLE></P>
<P>Enter the location of the COM server from which registration informationis to be extracted.  If the COM server is a service, check the Service EXEcheckbox.  Select a feature and component with which this COM server isassociated.  If you created the entries with izfree, the name of theappropriate feature and component will contain the filename of theserver.</P><P>Usually you will not need to edit the list of monitored registry keys.By default izfree monitors all the important registry keys for COM objectregistration as well as typical keys used to record other applicationconfiguration information.  If izfree misses some information from yourobject's self-registration process, you can add additional registry keysto the list.</P>
<LI><P>Click 'Next' to advance to the next step in the wizard sequence.izfree will self-register your COM server and extract
the registration information.  A summary of the extracted information will
be displayed.</P>

<P><TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="images/tut5-2.png.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></TD>
<TD><A HREF="images/tut5-2.png">K PNG</A>,<BR>
<A HREF="images/tut5-2.jpg">K JPEG</A></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

<P>If it looks like something from the registration was missed based on the
summary information, you can go back to the first page of the COM registration
wizard sequence and add additional registry keys in order to capture the
necessary information.</P>

<P>When you are satisfied with the information that has been extracted,
click the 'Finish' button to add the extracted information to the
database.</P>

<LI><P>Repeat the process for any additional COM servers in your project.
In this example, we repeat the process for the service EXE and note that
a record in the <STRONG>ServiceInstall</STRONG> table was extracted.</P>

<P><TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="images/tut5-3.png.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300></TD>
<TD><A HREF="images/tut5-3.png">K PNG</A>,<BR>
<A HREF="images/tut5-3.jpg">K JPEG</A></TD></TR></TABLE></P>

<LI><P>Save the changes to your database and exit izfree.  Open your database
in Orca to validate the added information.  The database should validate
without errors.</P>
</OL><P>As you can see, izfree 1.1 makes this process much simpler than doingit by hand.  Advanced uses of COM may still require that you understandthe COM-related database tables for fine tuning of the basics provided byizfree.</P>
