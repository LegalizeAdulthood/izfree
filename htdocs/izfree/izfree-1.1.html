<H1>What's New For Version 1.1</H1>

<P>This is a beta release.  I have tested the release on my own machine
(Windows 2000 Professional SP2, Visual C++ SP6, IE 5.01), but not on any
others.  If you encounter problems with the software, please file a
bug report on the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/izfree/">izfreeProject page</A>.</P>

<P>This version 1.1 release improves upon the previous 1.0 release as
follows.</P>

<UL><LI><P><STRONG>Help now provided via HTML Help</STRONG></P><P>Version 1.0 used a homebrew help system implemented through a second
HTML window activated by a scripted hotlink.  Version 1.1 uses HTML help
and provides a standard <CODE>.CHM</CODE> help file that is activated bypressing <CODE>F1</CODE>.</P>
<LI><P><STRONG>database-centric model replaces task-centric model</STRONG></P>

<P>Previously, izfree used a task-centric model and treated each tool as its own
isolated world, opening and closing the database each time a tool was
selected.  izfree now has a database-centric model, where the current open
database is shown at the top of the main window.  An asterisk next to
the database name indicates that changes have been made to the
database but not yet saved.  All the tools operate on the open database.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>New package tool is now a modal dialog</STRONG></P>

<P>In accordance with the new database-centric model of izfree,
creating a new package is now done through a modal dialog.  You either
open an existing database, or create a new one.  After you create a new
database, it becomes the open database.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>Improved dialog preview</STRONG></P>

<P>izfree now lists the names of standard dialogs corresponding to the
negative sequence numbers of the <STRONG>InstallUISequence</STRONG>
table, the dialog named by the <STRONG>ErrorDialog</STRONG> property,
as well as all authored dialogs listed in the
<STRONG>InstallUISequence</STRONG> table.</P>

<P>For each dialog, any <STRONG>NewDialog</STRONG> control events that
move to the next dialog in a sequence are displayed for the selected
dialog.  Selecting an event shows any condition and ordering
information associated with the control event.  Double-clicking an
event selects the corresponding dialog invoked by the event, allowing
a quick click-through of a dialog wizard sequence.</P>

<P>Once the preview window has been displayed, it remains visible
until the preview window is cleared or another tool is selected.  The
preview window always tracks the selected dialog in izfree.  You can
preview an entire dialog sequence simply by navigating the event table
in izfree with the preview window displayed.</P>

<P>Most UI sequence dialogs are coded to appear in the center of the
screen.  However, once the preview window has been displayed, new
dialogs will appear in the same relative location making it easy to
access izfree's GUI once the preview window has been moved out of the
way.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>New Table Validation tool</STRONG></P>

<P>The table validation tool shows all pertinent information for any
column in any table in the open database.  This is handy for learning
more about the allowed values when editing columns in Orca.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>Enhanced New Component tool</STRONG></P>

<P>The previous version supported creating new components from a
directory tree in a blank database.  No attempts were made to
coordinate the new database table entries with existing database table
entries.</P>

<P>The new components tool now coordinates more with the existing
database table entries so that new components can be added to an
existing installation database.</P>

<P>Each component created from the directory scan has a matching
feature.  The features from the scan are placed under an existing
feature in the database.  If no existing feature is appropriate, a
form is provided for creating a new feature under which the features
from the scan can be placed.</P>

<P>The directory table entries resulting from the scan also must be
rooted underneath an existing directory in the database.  Typically
this will be <CODE>TARGETDIR</CODE>.</P>

<P>The previous version of the New Component tool enforced the
sequence of operations by enabling and disabling buttons that
performed steps in the process.  New Component is now organized as a
wizard sequence, building up information about the new components to
be added until a final confirmation from the user commits those
components to the database.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>Version information extracted from files</STRONG></P>

<P>Previously, the new component tool built entires in the
<STRONG>File</STRONG> table and left the version column blank.  For
files with versions, you had to manually edit the version field in
Orca.</P>

<P>The new component tool now extracts the version number of the file
from its version resource.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>New COM Registration Tool</STRONG></P>

<P>Previously, all COM registration information had to be entered
by hand through Orca in a tedious and error-prone process.</P>

<P>The COM registration tool takes a self-registering COM server and
monitors the changes made to the registry during self-registration.
The changes in the registry are used to populate the
<STRONG>AppId</STRONG>, <STRONG>Class</STRONG>,
<STRONG>ProgId</STRONG>, <STRONG>TypeLib</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Registry</STRONG>, <STRONG>ServiceControl</STRONG>, and
<STRONG>ServiceInstall</STRONG> tables.</P>

</UL>

<H3>Future Work</H3>

<P>These are some of the ideas for things I will be adding to izfree over
time.  If you have something specific you'd like automated, feel free
to add a feature request on the izfree SourceForge.net project page.</P>

<P></UL>
<LI>interface improvements
<LI>optionally include dialog boxes for the New Package tool
<LI>wildcard selective directory scanning for the New Components tool
<LI>"MSI Shrink" tool to create very small installs for small files
<LI>Merge modules
<LI>Support an MSI build process
<LI>GUI dialog editor (a work in progress is included with 1.0)
</UL></P>

<P>I've entered specifics about these ideas there in the Feature Requests
tracker and the Tasks tracker.  If you are interested in helping with
the development of izfree, join SourceForge and <A

project maintainer, and request to be added to the project.</P>
