<H3>Free Tools for Windows Installer</H3>

<P>This is the alpha test release of version 1.0 of

the Orca database editor included in the Platform SDK.</P>

<P>izfree, formerly known as 'msidb', automates some
tasks specific to the authoring of MSI installation database files
with Orca.  Orca provides a basic way to edit database tables, but
doesn't create them automatically.  izfree automates
the following tasks:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Create new Windows Installer compatible GUIDs
<LI>Create a blank MSI package for editing
<LI>Create features and components that install a directory tree of files
<LI>Preview and clone user interface dialogs
</UL>

<P>izfree assumes that you are already familiar with Windows Installer
and the <A HREF="#MSISDK">MSI SDK documentation</A>.  If you are
completely new to Windows Installer, you might want to start with <A
HREF="#VSI">Visual Studio Installer</A> and experiment with creating
some simple installations and examining the msi with Orca.</P>

<P>The 1.0 alpha release of izfree.  Download the ZIP file and unpack
it to a temporary directory.  Then invoke <CODE>izfree.msi</CODE> to
install izfree onto your machine.  After installing izfree, you may
remove the unpacked contents of the zip file.  You must already have
Windows Installer installed on your machine in order to use izfree.</P>

0.2</A></STRONG></P>

<P>This is the initial incarnation of izfree.  msidb is an HTML file
with embedded client-side script that performs roughly the same tasks
as izfree.  izfree 1.0 is mostly a rework and polish of msidb 0.2.
The name was changed to avoid confusion with the MSI SDK tool
called MSIDB.EXE.</P>

<HR><H3><A NAME="msi">About Windows Installer</A></H3>

<P>When you consider the varied needs of install programs and the
method by which they interact with the system to perform updates,
you can easily imagine that a complete specifications of the actions
of install programs covers quite a bit of territory.  What follows
in this section is a summary of Windows Installer.  For more
information see the SDK documentation linked at the end of this
document.</P>

<P>Windows Installer is a system component provided by Microsoft to
address the problem of 'DLL Hell' and poor installation programs.
Windows Installer is available as a redistributable for Windows 95,
Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0.  Windows Installer is included in
Windows Me, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.</P>

<P>Use of Windows Installer is required for Windows 2000 logo
certification and will continue to be a standard installation
technology for Microsoft platforms with XP, .NET and beyond.</P>

<P>Windows Installer uses a database of information about the
application to be installed to determine what resources to install from
source media onto the target machine.  Resources may be files, fonts,
registry entries, COM servers, NT services, and any other piece of
data that is required by your application.  The database is stored
in a file with the extension '<CODE>.msi</CODE>'.</P>

<P>Windows Installer caches the database onto the target machine when
a product is installed.  The cached database can be used to perform
repair operations in case of accidental deletion or corruption of
resources.  The cached database is also used to remove the application
completely, or to install or remove specific features provided by the
application.</P>

converter</A></STRONG></P>

<P>Converts your MSI database into an XML text representation that is
perfect for source code control systems as you revise your MSI over
time.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG><A NAME="VSI" HREF=
"http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/vsi11/default.asp">Visual
Studio Installer</A></STRONG></P>

<P>A free add-on for Microsoft Visual Studio users.  It provides a GUI
environment for editing a simple installation containing files, COM
objects, registry entries, etc.  It does not expose the more powerful
features of Windows Installer technology such as custom actions,
custom dialogs, Win32 service control and installation.
This is a good free tool provided you already own Studio and your
installation needs are simply copying files, modifying the registry
and registration of COM objects.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG><A NAME="MSISDK" HREF=
"http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/">Platform
SDK Update</A></STRONG></P>

<P>After release 1.2 of Windows Installer, it was packaged with the
Platform SDK.  As new releases of the Platform SDK are issued, new
versions of Windows Installer are released.  As of December,
2001 the Platform SDK included version 2.0 of Windows Installer.  The
Platform SDK documentation describes the additional features included
in successive versions of Windows Installer.
</P>

<P>The Platform SDK installs Orca.msi as with the version 1.2 of the
MSI SDK.  Use Orca.msi to install the Orca database editor.</P>

1.2</A></STRONG></P> 

<P>After downloading and installing the SDK, install Orca.msi to get
the Orca database editor.  Orca.msi is located in the '%MSSDK%\bin'
directory after you install the Platform SDK.</P>

<P>Merge modules for libraries provided with Visual Studio 6.0 Service
Pack 4.  If your code depends on these libraries, such as comdlg32.ocx
or oleaut32.dll, then you should use the merge modules to ensure that
the proper versions of these components are installed for use with
your application.</P>

Cabinet SDK</A></STRONG></P>

<P>The Cabinet SDK gives you documentation on the cabinet file format
and associated tools for manipulating cabinet files (makecab, cabarc,
etc.).</P>

<P>Windows Installer uses cabinet files for compressed storage and for
web based installations.  Windows Installer imposes sequence requirements
relating the <STRONG>File</STRONG> table entries to the order of files
in a cabinet file.  The Cabinet SDK contains documentation describing how
to construct cabinet files to match the Windows Installer constraints.</P>

<P>The <CODE>WiMakCab.vbs</CODE> script in the MSI SDK builds a
cabinet file using <CODE>MAKECAB.EXE</CODE>, which it assumes will be
somewhere in your path.  If you don't have this tool, you can get it
by installing the Cabinet SDK.</P>
