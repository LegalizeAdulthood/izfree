<H2>Tutorial 6: Installing a Service</H2>

<P>A <EM>Windows NT service</EM> is a special executable program run by
the system for performing background tasks.  Windows 9x/Me does not support
services.  On Windows NT-based systems (Windows NT, Windows 2000, and
Windows XP), Windows Installer itself has a service executable that is
used to execute the installation script generated from your database.</P>

<P>Services run in a different security context than the interactive user,
and by default they run as the <CODE>Local System</CODE> account.  While
the local system account is considered part of the "trusted computing
base" and has god-like powers over the system, it also has a very restricted
operating environment.  For instance, the local system account does not
have permission to access file shares on the network.  For
more about services, see the book "<CITE>Professional NT Services</CITE>"
by Kevin
Miller.  For more about the Windows NT security model, see the book
"<CITE>Programming Windows Security</CITE>" by Keith Brown.</P>

<P>Windows Installer manipulates services through the information contained
in the <STRONG>ServiceControl</STRONG> and <STRONG>ServiceInstall</STRONG>
database tables.  This information is used by the standard actions
<STRONG>StopServices</STRONG>
<STRONG>DeleteServices</STRONG>
<STRONG>InstallServices</STRONG>
and
<STRONG>StartServices</STRONG>.</P>

<P>Packages with services generally need to control services, install
new services, and possibly set security context information on newly
installed services.</P>

<OL>
<LI><P>To install a service, you need to populate a row of the
<STRONG>ServiceInstall</STRONG> table for each service to be installed.
The information in this table corresponds to the arguments passed to
the <CODE>::CreateService</CODE> Win32 API function.  If your service
was created by the ATL AppWizard in Visual Studio, then you can extract
the information for this database table directly from the generated
code.</P>

<P>Many services are related and depend on each other for proper
functioning.  This information is recorded in the <STRONG>Dependencies</STRONG>
column of the <STRONG>ServiceInstall</STRONG> table.  COM EXE servers always
depend on the service <CODE>RPCSS</CODE> (Remote Procedure Call System
Service).  izfree can automatically extract rows of the
<STRONG>ServiceInstall</STRONG> table for COM services that create a
service as part of their self-registration process.</P>

<LI><P>If your service is a COM server, make sure that an entry
for your COM server has been entered into the <STRONG>AppId</STRONG>
table.  Your COM server may fail to start if this information is not
present.</P>

<LI><P>You can manipulate any service through the
<STRONG>ServiceControl</STRONG> table.  For instance, your package might
require that a service be restarted in order to find new information added
by your package.</P>

<LI><P>If your service requires a specific security context, you will need
custom actions to provide that security context.  For instance, you may
want the service to run as a specific account which is created with the
installation of the package.  This reduces the chance that the system
could be used to compromise the security of the target machine, since the
service will be running in a restricted security context.  The local system
account is considered part of the "trusted computing base" and you should
not run your services as the local system account unless absolutely
necessary.</P>

<P>Windows Installer does not include any tables for manipulating the
security context of the target machine (local user accounts, local groups,
access rights, permissions, etc.)
The MSI SDK contains an example of a custom action that creates user
accounts.  You will need to create any special user accounts before any
service using such an account is installed.</P>

<P>Any security information associated with a COM server, such as that
configured by <CODE>DCOMNCFG</CODE> will also need a custom action for
adding and removing this information.  The <STRONG>AppId</STRONG> table
does not provide a way to set security permissions on a COM server.</P>
