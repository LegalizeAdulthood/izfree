<H3>Tutorial 5: Registering COM Objects</H3>

<P>COM objects are reusable bits of software distributed in binary
form.  COM objects register themselves with the system to make
themselves accessible to applications.  Registration is the process of
writing data to the system registry that identifies the location of
the COM object's executable file and its properties.</P>

<P>COM objects installed by an application need to be registered on the
target machine.  Similarly, the registration information must be
removed when the object itself is removed.  Windows Installer provides
several tables for recording the registration information for a COM
object.</P>

<P>
The <STRONG>Class</STRONG>,
<STRONG>ProgId</STRONG>,
<STRONG>TypeLib</STRONG>,
<STRONG>AppId</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Extension</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Registry</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Verb</STRONG>, and
<STRONG>MIME</STRONG> tables provide for the registration of COM
objects.  There is quite a bit of information in those tables, and its
quite tedious to enter it all by hand.  However, doing so at least
once will make you familiar with the purpose of all the tables and how
they are used in your installation.  This understanding is invaluable
in debugging COM registration problems.</P>

<OL
<LI><P>First, gather the necessary registration information for your
code.  This involves at a minimum your object's CLSID information
under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{your guid} when the object is
registered.  If the component is not registered, then you will have to
extract the necessary information from your source code or documentation.
Information under your object's CLSID is entered into corresdonding
entries in the <STRONG>Class</STRONG> table.  Make a note of any
information that you haven't yet entered into the class table for
later.</P>

<LI><P>The object may also have a ProgId.  If so, this will be
indicated
