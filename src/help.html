<H2>izfree Tools for Windows Installer Help</H2>

<P>izfree is a collection of tools for automating common tasks when
authoring Windows Installer databases (<CODE>.MSI</CODE> files).
izfree is intended to be used in conjunction with Orca, when a task in
Orca is too cumbersome, tedious, or error-prone.
</P>

<P>izfree consists of a main window that displays the currently open
database along the top, a menu of tools along the left and an inset
frame that changes to display information for the currently selected
tool.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Open</STRONG>, <STRONG>New...</STRONG>, <STRONG>Save</STRONG>,
and <STRONG>Close</STRONG> buttons operate on the current database.
<STRONG>Open</STRONG> displays a dialog to browse for an existing database.
<STRONG>New...</STRONG> displays a modal dialog for the creation of a
<A HREF="#NewPackage">new database package</A> constructed from templates.</P>

<P><STRONG>Save</STRONG> saves any modifications to the database.  When
a database has been modified, an asterisk is displayed to the right of the
database name.  </STRONG>Close</STRONG> closes any open database.  If the
database has been modified, you are prompted to save your changes before
the database is closed.  Similarly, if the application window itself is
closed and the database has been modified, you are prompted to save your
changes before the application exits.</P>

<DIV ID="divNewGUID">
<H3><A NAME="NewGUID">Create New GUID</A></H3>
<P>Windows Installer requires GUIDs that have no lower case letters.
Tools like UUIDGEN and GUIDGEN generate GUIDs with lower case letters.
This simple tool generates a GUID and ensures that all the letters
are in upper case.  The result is placed in a text box for copy/paste
into Orca or some other Windows Installer related utility.</P>

<P>izfree always starts with the new guid tool displayed.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="divNewPackage">
<H3><A NAME="NewPackage">New Package</A></H3>

<P>This tool creates a blank installation database that validates in Orca
with no errors.  A new installation package can be created by merging
the contents of several template files into a single database and
entering a few minimal rows into the <STRONG>Property</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Directory</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Feature</STRONG> tables.
izfree also creates required values in the summary information
stream.  The text fields allow you to provide the necessary required
information.  You can enter your own GUIDs or generate new GUIDs for
the fields requiring GUIDs.  If you are not sure, generate new GUIDs.</P>

<P>The installation directory is used to create a base installation
directory on the target machine.  izfree creates several rows in the
<STRONG>Directory</STRONG> table to create your installation directory,
which will be associated with the '<CODE>APPDIR</CODE>' public
property.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Feature</STRONG> table is populated with a single row
for a feature called '<CODE>All</CODE>' intended to contain all
other features added to the installation.</P>

<P>The Windows Installer SDK samples include several template files
that can be used as the basis of an installation.  These files are:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>schema.msi</STRONG>
<DD>A blank database schema containing unpopulated database tables.
<DT><STRONG>Sequence.msi</STRONG>
<DD>This database contains the sequence tables
<STRONG>InstallUISequence</STRONG>,
<STRONG>InstallExecuteSequence</STRONG>,
<STRONG>AdminUISequence</STRONG>,
<STRONG>AdminExecuteSequence</STRONG>,
<STRONG>AdvtUISequence</STRONG>,
<STRONG>AdvtExecuteSequence</STRONG>.  The tables are prepopulated
with the suggested standard sequence as described in the SDK.
<DT><STRONG>UISample.msi</STRONG>
<DD>This database contains a simple installation user 
  interface as a collection of dialogs.</DD>       
</DL></P>

<P>izfree uses these templates to create your blank installation
database.  The only requirement izfree imposes on the templates is
that they have the names given above and that when combined they
include a <STRONG>Property</STRONG>, <STRONG>Directory</STRONG> and
<STRONG>Feature</STRONG> table.  You can use Orca to edit the templates
and customize them for your organization.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="divNewComponents">
<H3><A NAME="NewComponents">New Components</A></H3>

<P>This tool scans a directory tree and minimally constructs rows for
the <STRONG>File</STRONG>, <STRONG>Directory</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Media</STRONG>, <STRONG>Component</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Feature</STRONG>, and <STRONG>FeatureComponents</STRONG>
tables.  It displays the components and their associated files in a
tree view after the directories have been scanned.</P>

<P>This form works in stages.  Use the Next, Back, Cancel and Finish
buttons to navigate through the stages in the process of creating
components from a direcotry tree.</P>

<OL>
<LI><P><STRONG>Select Scan Directory</STRONG></P>

<P>First construct a directory containing
your installation as you would like it organized on the distribution
media.  Then enter the path of that directory into stage 1 and click
the Next button.  This scans the directory and automatically creates
components for the directory contents.  Any file containing a Win32
version resource, or having the extension "<CODE>exe</CODE>",
"<CODE>dll</CODE>", or "<CODE>ocx</CODE>"
will be placed in its own component.
All the remaining files that
don't require their own component are collected into a component for
that directory.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>Modify Generated Components</STRONG></P>

<P>Once the tree view has been populated with components, you can examine
the components and files that were generated from the directory scan.
Each component, displayed as a root node in the treeview, contains one
or more files, displayed as child nodes.  You can edit the component
names if you wish.  When a file or component is selected in the treeview
control, the source and target directory paths are displayed on the
right.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>Locate New Components Under a Feature and Directory</STRONG></P>

<P>When new components and features are added to a package, they must
be located relative to the other features in the package.  On the left
is a tree view display of the existing features in the database.  You can
select an existing feature from the tree view, or create a new feature
in the database using the form on the right.</P>

<P>Above the tree view is a listbox of the defined directories in the
database.  Select one of the directories to use as the installation
directory for the new components.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>Commit Components to the Database</STRONG></P>

<P>The final step in the process displays a summary of the action about
to be taken.  Clicking 'Finish' adds the relevant information to the
database.</P>

</OL>

<P>This is a minimal installation that only copies files.  It doesn't
automatically detect COM components or enter their registration information
into the installation.  It doesn't control services, the registry, search
for files/applications, etc.  izfree provides a tool for extracting
COM registration from a self-registering COM object.  For the remaining
operations, you will need to use Orca.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="divCOMRegistration">
<H3><A NAME="COMRegistration">COM Registration</A></H3>
<P>izfree can extract COM registration information from self-registering
COM servers and use this information to populate the <STRONG>AppId</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Class</STRONG>, <STRONG>ProgId</STRONG>, <STRONG>TypeLib</STRONG>,
and <STRONG>Registry</STRONG> tables.  For COM servers that are also
Windows NT services, izfree can extract the service creation information
to populate the <STRONG>ServiceInstall</STRONG> table.</P>

<P>Extracting COM registration information is a two step process.

<OL>
<LI><P><STRONG>Select COM Server</STRONG></P>
<P>First, enter the path of the file containing the COM server.  This
will usually be a file with a <CODE>DLL</CODE>, <CODE>EXE</CODE>, or
<CODE>OCX</CODE> extension, but izfree does not require any particular
extension.  If the file is a Windows NT service, check the service
<CODE>EXE</CODE> box.  Select the component and feature with which to
associate the extracted information.</P>

<P>izfree extracts COM registration information by monitoring changes to
the registry.  The default list of registry keys covers all the standard
COM registration information written into the registry.  However, if you
need to extract additional information written into the registyr, you
may modify the list of registry keys that are monitored.</P>

<P>Click the Next button to self-register the named file and extract
the information from the system registry.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>Confirm Database Rows Added</STRONG></P>

<P>izfree displays a summary of the information that was extracted from
the registry.  Click the Finish button to add the information to the
database.  Click Cancel or Back to return to the first step of the
COM registration process.</P>
</OL>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="divPreviewDialogs">
<H3><A NAME="PreviewDialogs">Preview and Clone Dialogs</A></H3>

<P>This tool allows you to preview the user interface dialogs within an
installation database.  The standard user interface dialog names are displayed
on the right.  The standard user interface dialogs include the
dialog named by the <STRONG>ErrorDialog</STRONG> property and those
associated with the sequence numbers -3, -2, and -1 in the
<STRONG>InstallUISequence</STRONG> table.</P>

<P>A dialog sequence can be initiated by placing the name of the dialog
in the <STRONG>InstallUISequence</STRONG> table as the name of the action to
be executed.  These UI dialogs are shown in the dropdown listbox on the
right, above the standard dialogs.</P>

<P>Selecting a standard dialog name, or one of the UI dialogs from the
listbox results in the corresponding dialog being selected on the left.</P>

<P>Each dialog contains any number of controls and each control can generate
any number of events through user interaction.  Once a dialog has been
selected, any events that  change the current dialog are
displayed in the event section beneath the dialog information.  For each
such event, the name of the control that generates the event and the
target dialog are shown.</P>

<P>Selecting an event from the list displays event detail information on
the right.  Many controls have conditions on their events to branch from
one dialog to several depending on the result of the condition.</P>

<P>Double-clicking an event in the list changes the currently selected
dialog to the target of the event.  This allows you to walk through a
dialog wizard sequence without running an actual installation.</P>

<P>The display of the preview window is independent of any other interaction
with the tool.  You can display the preview window and use the tool to
navigate through wizard sequences and the preview window will always track
the current dialog selected in the tool.</P>

<P>Cloning a dialog duplicates the dialog-related entries in the
<STRONG>Dialog</STRONG>, <STRONG>Control</STRONG>,
<STRONG>ControlEvent</STRONG> and <STRONG>EventMapping</STRONG> tables,
substituting the original dialog name for a new user-supplied dialog
name.  This is useful for making a new dialog based on an existing
dialog.</P>

<DIV ID="divTableValidation">
<H3><A NAME="TableValidation">Database Table Validation Information</A></H3>
<P>The table validation tool provides detailed information about each
database table column.  It uses the <STRONG>_Validation</STRONG> table
and the database object to obtain the relevant information about each
field.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Column Type</STRONG> value gives the database type for
the column.  Windows Installer also has a datatype for the column, given
by the <STRONG>Category</STRONG> value.  The Windows Installer datatype
will supply additional semantics beyond the database type.  For instance,
the database type for a GUID string is <CODE>s38</CODE>, but a
Windows Installer <STRONG>GUID</STRONG> type imposes additional constraints
on the string.</P>

<P>The <STRONG>Key Table</STRONG> and <STRONG>Key Column</STRONG> values
are non-NULL if this column is a foreign key into another table.  The
<STRONG>Category</STRONG> value gives the Windows Installer datatype
for the column.  For enumerated datatypes, the <STRONG>Set</STRONG>
value gives the acceptable values for the column.</P>
