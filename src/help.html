<DIV ID="divNewGUID" CLASS="invisible">
<H3><A NAME="NewGUID">Create New GUID</A></H3>
<P>Windows Installer requires GUIDs that have no lower case letters.
Tools like UUIDGEN and GUIDGEN generate GUIDs with lower case letters.
This simple script generates a GUID and ensures that all the letters
are in upper case.  The result is placed in a text box for copy/paste
into Orca or some other Windows Installer related utility.</P>

<P><INPUT TYPE="button" VALUE="Ok" onClick="window.close"></P>
</DIV>

<DIV ID="divNewPackage" CLASS="invisible">
<H3><A NAME="NewPackage">Create a New Installation Package</A></H3>

<P>This form creates a blank installation database that validates in Orca
with no errors.
A new installation package can be created by merging the contents
of the template files into a single database and setting a few properties
on the database and the summary information stream.  The text fields
allow you to provide the necessary required information.  You can enter
your own GUIDs or generate new GUIDs for the fields requiring GUIDs.</P>

<P>The Windows Installer SDK samples include several template files
that can be used as the basis of an installation.  These files are:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>schema.msi</STRONG>
<DD>A blank database schema containing unpopulated database tables.
<DT><STRONG>Sequence.msi</STRONG>
<DD>This database contains the sequence tables InstallUISequence,
InstallExecuteSequence, AdminUISequence, AdminExecuteSequence,
AdvtUISequence, AdvtExecuteSequence.  The tables are prepopulated
with the suggested standard sequence as described in the SDK docs.
<DT><STRONG>UISample.msi</STRONG>
<DD>This database contains a simple installation user 
  interface as a collection of dialogs.</DD>

<DIV ID="divNewComponents" CLASS="invisible">
<H3><A NAME="NewComponents">Scan a Directory for Components</A></H3>

<P>This form scans a directory tree and minimally constructs rows for
the File, Directory, Media, Component, Feature, and FeatureComponents
tables.  It displays the components and their associated files in a
tree view after the directories have been scanned.</P>

<P>This form works in two stages.  First construct a directory containing
your installation as you would like it organized on the distribution
media.  Then enter the path of that directory into the form and click
the scan button.  This scans the directory and automatically creates
components for the directory contents.  All files in a directory that
don't require their own component are collected into a component for
that directory.</P>

<P>Once the tree view has been populated with components, enter the name
of an existing MSI database and click the save button to insert the necessary
rows into the File, Directory, Media, Component, Feature and FeatureComponent
tables.
If you don't have an existing MSI database, use the create package form
to create one.</P>

<P>A single feature named "All" is the parent of all the other features
created.  A feature is created for each component in the installation.
The source and target directory hierarchies are identical.</P>

<P>This is a minimal installation that only copies files.  It doesn't
automatically detect COM components or enter their registration information
into the installation.  It doesn't control services, the registry, search
for files/applications, etc., etc., etc.  Use Orca or some other MSI editor
to add that information to the installation database after this form
generates your basic installation.</P>

<DIV ID="divPreviewDialogs" CLASS="invisible">
<H3><A NAME="PreviewDialogs">User Interface Dialog Tools</A></H3>

<P>This form allows you to preview the user interface 
dialogs within an installation database. When a database is opened, the list box 
is populated with the names of the dialoags in the databse. Select a dialog name 
and then click the Preview button to display the dialog. To end the display of 
the dialog click the Clear button. Select the close button before opening 
another database.</P>

<P>You can also clone an existing dialog into the installation 
database.</P>
